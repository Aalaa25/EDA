# 📊 Data Visualization Project — American Universities Preferences

This project analyzes what features most influence students' decisions when selecting a preferred American university. It focuses on factors like application rates, admission rates, costs, university type, and the socioeconomic characteristics of the university's state.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To determine the **most relevant features** students consider when choosing their university by analyzing and visualizing:

- Number of applications, admissions, and enrollments  
- Tuition and on-campus living costs  
- Type of institution (public vs private)  
- Degree availability  
- State-level indicators (population, GDP per capita)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this project was taken from [Kaggle: American University Data (IPEDS Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/sumithbhongale/american-university-data-ipeds-dataset).

## ❓ Hypotheses Explored

1. Do universities with a high number of applications represent student preference?  
2. Do students prefer universities with higher admission rates (easier acceptance)?  
3. Is there a stronger preference for public vs private institutions?  
4. Do students prefer universities with lower tuition and fees?  
5. Is low on-campus living cost a deciding factor?  
6. Are universities in more populated states more attractive?  
7. Do states with high GDP per capita influence student preference?  
8. Does the availability of additional academic degrees at a university increase its attractiveness?
